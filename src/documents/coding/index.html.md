This is the section where I get my geek on and share everything from code strategies to specific language how-to. This section may have articles touching on any aspect of web development, including HTML markup *(yeah, I know its not code)*, CSS *(also not code)*, jQuery/JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Node.js and Erlang (If I ever get around to learning it!).
