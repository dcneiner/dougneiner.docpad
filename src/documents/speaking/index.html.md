If you spend any time around me at all, you will quickly realize I enjoy talking. Once you know that, its not too surprising to find out I also enjoy speaking to audiences large and small. I feel the audience gets the most benefit when I am talking about topics I am passionate about, including [jQuery](http://jquery.com), [Amplify JS](http://amplifyjs.com), and Design.

Over the past few years I have had the pleasure of presenting at a number of conferences across America and even one in London:

* jQuery San Francisco Bay Area Conference (2010, 2011)
* jQuery Boston Conference (2010, 2011)
* RIA Unleashed (2010, 2011)
* Front End Design Conference (2011)
* jQuery UK Conference (2012)

If you are interested in having me speak at your conference, please [drop me a line](mailto:doug@dougneiner.com?subject=Conference).

Here are a few reviews from people who have attended my talks:

> Just awesome! One of the best presentations at jqcon. Excellent delivery, pacing and code samples. Some great ideas that I will most certainly use. &mdash; **[Bob Moore](http://twitter.com/Remoorejr)**


> Doug theme-rolled the conference with this talk. They should give this guy a whole day. Super useful, well presented, funny and engaging. &mdash; **[lewsid](http://speakerrate.com/talks/8519-contextual-jquery-in-practice#c16337)**


> Clear, practical, and applicable. Most useful presentation of the weekend! I've already rewritten a very complex UI using the material presented. &mdash; **[tom](http://speakerrate.com/talks/8519-contextual-jquery-in-practice#c16374)**


> Doug is always a brilliant presenter. Speaks loud and clearly while delivering invaluable information. As he mentioned his goal for his talks is that we leave knowing there is something in our code we can change, he certainly helped me attain that as I am excited to implement new techniques I have learned. Thanks Doug! &mdash; **[Ryan Olson](http://twitter.com/#!/ryanolson)**
